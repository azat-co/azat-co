          <section class="content"><p>Working is important. It not only provides material means, social status and pride in a well work done, but also meaning and motivation which in tern extend a person’s life. According to <a href="http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2016/03/21/jech-2015-207097.short">some studies</a>, people who retire and don’t find another activity, die fast. Or that tech millionaires are unhappy once they are let go or fire, or that lottery winners are miss the&nbsp;working. </p>
<p>However, resting is important too and helps to avoid burn-out and all kids of nasty nervous diseases which tend to decrease one’s life. Working productively while having rest once in a while is the best approach. 👨‍💻🔄🛌  <strong>What’s crazy is that many people do things which they think is resting but in fact they are draining their energy even more.</strong> Here are some of these things. Some of them might shock&nbsp;you!</p>
<ul>
<li>Going out on the weekend: Breaking your sleep cycle with loud noise, excessive drinking or eating - not&nbsp;good.</li>
<li>Traveling, especially stressful traveling: Being in a nice place taken care of by the hotel staff and restaurants is nice but the traveling itself is almost always a stress (airport, planes, traffic). Trying new food and changing time zones are bad stressors&nbsp;to. </li>
<li>Watching sports, <span class="caps">TV</span> shows or news: they all drain your energy because your body is passive yet emotions and adrenaline glands are&nbsp;not.</li>
<li>Being on social media: More people feel depressed after using social media due to “success theatre” and the addiction mechanism of&nbsp;novelty.</li>
<li>Multitasking: Not being in the present and flow state, e.g., when you at your kids soccer game, don’t text with work. That’s a disservice to you, work and your family. Be present whatever you do. Put your phone on an airplane mode. Most likely you are not a firefighter or a brain surgeon. You work can wait until the weekend is&nbsp;over.</li>
<li>Not sleeping enough or waking up on the weekend at different&nbsp;hours.</li>
<li>Eating refined carbs (pizza, pasta, juices, smoothies): Sugar is easily digestible form spike insulin and very toxic for your&nbsp;body.</li>
<li>Not getting resistance training and doing too much chronic cardio: Chronic cardio is a huge stressor, tough on joints and ages people&nbsp;fast.</li>
<li>Smoking weed: If smoking tobacco causes cancer due to the burned stuff that people inhale, then why burning weed and smoking it <em>wouldn’t</em> cause cancer&nbsp;too?</li>
<li>Hanging out with “friends”: Wrong type of friends can bring drama and having too much drama in your life is not good for mental&nbsp;health.</li>
<li>Postponing important things, i.e., procrastination: It might feel good short-term to postpone an important project or a decision but it’ll snowball stress in the&nbsp;long-term.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably more things which are misleading to people. They mask as rest but actually suck up your energy. I would say not watching news or <span class="caps">TV</span> shows and having enough sleep are two most important which will give the majority the most bang for their buck. Focus on that if you feel&nbsp;tired!</p>
