          <section class="content"><p>Let me share a little secret. ðŸ˜‰  While itâ€™s nice to get a discount and save a few bucks, especially when youâ€™re going to buy a thing anyway, there is something magical in when you pay a full price. Youâ€™ll tend to enjoy the thing more, feel better about yourself and use the thing more&nbsp;often.</p>
<p>Studies show that this phenomenon of getting benefits of paying the full price (or a premium) is even more applicable to buying something special, something experiential such as an online course, a music <span class="caps">CD</span> (which see only at Whole Foods and Starbucks checkout lines), or an event like a seminar or a conference. How many online courses or books did you buy on at a discount and never finished them? ðŸ“– I bet way, way more than the ones for which youâ€™ve paid a full price (and a high&nbsp;one)!</p>
<p>Human brains are wired to appreciate according to the price youâ€™ve paid so buy torrenting a book or a movie or buy looking for coupons to your favorite artistsâ€™ or speakerâ€™s performanceâ€”you are robbing yourself from a pleasure. It took me a while to realize it, but once I did ðŸ’¡, I started buying music on iTunes and now subscribe to Spotify as a way to appreciate and give back to my favorite&nbsp;artists.</p>
<p>With commodities, which are all the same, you can get the same sweet potato chips from any website which sells them, so buying the cheapest and most convenient is less damaging to the pleasure (but still&nbsp;is).</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s why luxury industry exists. The quality of a Gucci bag is not 100 times better. Itâ€™s roughly the same. The bonus is in the enjoyment. This principle applies to non-monetary payment, for example when working on a book or a PhDâ€”thatâ€™s hard and painful sometimes. However, most people treasure the results and outcomes more after a tougher&nbsp;journey.</p>
<p>So either pay a full price or pretend that you did (and then forget that you pretended), because youâ€™ll get more usage of whatever that thing&nbsp;is.</p>
