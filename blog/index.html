            <h2><a href="/blog/carnivore-superpowers/">Carnivore Superpowers</a></h2>

          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/carnivore-superpowers/lions.jpg" alt="Lions resting"></p>
<p>It’s been ten years since my <a href="https://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers/">paleo superpowers</a> post. And while paleo is good, carnivore is even better. It’s like having double the amount of superpowers, including but not limited to the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul>
<li>More mental clarity and better problem&nbsp;solving.</li>
<li>More more because less sleep is&nbsp;needed.</li>
<li>Fewer sport&nbsp;injuries.</li>
<li>Faster recovery from flu/cold, sickness, if I ever get it (typically&nbsp;not).</li>
<li>Being able to skip meals and do multi-day water-only&nbsp;fasting.</li>
<li>More energy, no sluggishness after&nbsp;meals.</li>
<li>Calmer mood and better handling of stressful&nbsp;situations.</li>
<li>Meal prep is 1-2 minutes because there are veggies that require most of the time to peel, slice and&nbsp;cook.</li>
<li>It’s easier to live because grocery shopping and restaurant menu choosing are much, much faster (less is&nbsp;more).</li>
</ul>
<p>Carnivore diet and their variations (Lion Diet) are probably the best life hack out there. The facts are&nbsp;obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carnivore is the evolutionary diet, that’s how our ancestors ate and how humans evolved to&nbsp;eat.</li>
<li>Animal food (i.e., meat) is the most nutrient and bio-available&nbsp;food.</li>
<li>Carnivore is the ultimate elimination diet for autoimmune&nbsp;conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been already proven to be the original human diet but sadly most doctors and people don’t know about it. And even if they have heard about it, they dismiss it as dangerous or a fad. It’ll be funny to look back in 20-40 years when the popular opinion will change to favor carnivore-like&nbsp;diets.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/colombia-23/">Travel Log: Bogota and Medellin, Colombia 2023</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/colombia-23/medellin-23.jpeg" alt="Bogota and Medellin, Colombia 2023"></p>
<p>Here are my key impressions from a recent trip to Colombia, to the cities of Bogota and&nbsp;Medellin.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nicer parts of cites like Park 93, Verrey or El Poblado are very walkable and very European and less “American” (i.e., big roads, must have cars, not&nbsp;walkable).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The food is more european with less salsas and&nbsp;spices</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bogota is cold but again it reminded me of European cloudy skies in Scandinavia, London or&nbsp;Russia.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are a lot of hookah places in El Poblado and in Bogota they have small shops with tables on the streets to&nbsp;smoke</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are a lot of peddlers and beggars on the street that are very persistent and&nbsp;annoying.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People love bicycles, running and their&nbsp;dogs. </p>
</li>
<li><p>There are a lot of greens (trees, bushes,&nbsp;grass).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Meat is superb and has a very natural grass-fed&nbsp;flavor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avianca tries to be a low-cost airline charging for everything extra (seat selection, soda, juice, small roller&nbsp;suitcase).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Roads are good and tunnels are moderns but traffic in rush hours suck. Even Pico y Placa doesn’t help. It’s better to walk or take a bike, or ride motorbike if you’re&nbsp;local.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bogota restaurants are better than Medellin&nbsp;restaurants.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bogota hotels are cheaper than Medellin&nbsp;hotels.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Uber can call a regular&nbsp;taxi.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cash is not needed for a week-long trip except to buy fruits from street vendors who are too lazy to get a card&nbsp;terminal.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <h2><a href="/blog/big-fish/">Big Fish in a Small Pound 🐟</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It’s good to be a big fish in a small pond. It gives more visibility, uniqueness and influence that bring more opportunities. Also, it’s easier to migrate to a larger pond when you grow to a big fish in a small pond. So first, we all should focus on becoming a big fish in our current (probably small) pond. Stories of success of growing to a big fish in a large pond are mostly survivor bias type stories or overnight success stories that took 10 years in the making… and a lot of jumps from small pond to bigger pond and then eventually to open&nbsp;ocean! </p>
<p>If the pond is too small, if you think that it’s not thrilling, motivating nor exciting to grow into a big fish there, then please take a second look. Probably, the pond is still big enough to be a stepping stone. A lot of startups try to launch straightway in the <span class="caps">US</span> or at least Europe while being from developing countries. That’s a big mistake because they are far from their customers and have all sorts of disadvantages of not playing on their&nbsp;home-field. </p>

          <section class="content"><p>This is the summary of my 2 years doing the master’s program. I received my paper diploma last week. I was awarded Master of Science with honors (only 10% of students get this high recognition). A few weeks ago, we had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_brulB6490">a virtual graduation ceremony</a>. I hope to visit the campus next year to reunite in person with my&nbsp;classmates. </p>
<p>While waiting for the diploma, I had a previlige to host a webinar with one of our professors, Prof. Etienne <span class="caps">KRIEGER</span> — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v1cEqGGXGI"><span class="caps">MSIE</span> Webinar : How to Overcome Conflicts Between Associates</a>. I shared my tips on forming a team and working out conflicts between startup&nbsp;founders.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>The team project for my master’s degree in Innovation and Entreprenurship from <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris took about a year. First, we were a team of four people. Then one person dropped out of the program and we were left just three of us: two guys from Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area and one guy from&nbsp;France. </p>
<p>Anyone could have pitched their own idea to the whole cohort so that the most popular ideas attract teammates to collaborate. Some team had as many as six&nbsp;people! </p>

<p>Now, the only thing is left is to finish the team project that my team of three worked on for the pretty much the entire year. My team and I have to present the pitch deck for our product to the jury in a similar way how the startups pitch investors. We’ll get our grades and finish our Master of Science&nbsp;degree.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>I’m 3/4 into the Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (<span class="caps">MSIE</span>) degree program at HEC Paris, and it is a time to write a reflection on my experience. I’ll think about whether it was worth the time and effort, and of course if I’m getting what I&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that a lot of universities and colleges moved to virtual classes. We, at <span class="caps">MSIE</span>, had a 100% virtual/online program from the beginning. Our cohort is number four which means HEC and Coursera figured out a lot of issues that they might have had before, like in any version 1.0 product. My cohort started in Jun 2019 so this post mark a year into the&nbsp;program.</p>
