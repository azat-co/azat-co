          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is the summary of my 2 years doing the master’s program. I received my paper diploma last week. I was awarded Master of Science with honors (only 10% of students get this high recognition). A few weeks ago, we had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_brulB6490">a virtual graduation ceremony</a>. I hope to visit the campus next year to reunite in person with my&nbsp;classmates. </p>
<p>While waiting for the diploma, I had a previlige to host a webinar with one of our professors, Prof. Etienne <span class="caps">KRIEGER</span> — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v1cEqGGXGI"><span class="caps">MSIE</span> Webinar : How to Overcome Conflicts Between Associates</a>. I shared my tips on forming a team and working out conflicts between startup&nbsp;founders.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>The team project for my master’s degree in Innovation and Entreprenurship from <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris took about a year. First, we were a team of four people. Then one person dropped out of the program and we were left just three of us: two guys from Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area and one guy from&nbsp;France. </p>
<p>Anyone could have pitched their own idea to the whole cohort so that the most popular ideas attract teammates to collaborate. Some team had as many as six&nbsp;people! </p>

          <section class="content"><p>Today, I just finished the last (20<span class="ord">th</span>) course for the <span class="caps">MSIE</span> program. The course was on Venture Capital and Private Equity and it concludes the academic part of the masters program. I wrote academic because the courses weren’t just theoretical. We did had a lot of practice preparing our assignments and working on business&nbsp;cases. </p>
<p>Now, the only thing is left is to finish the team project that my team of three worked on for the pretty much the entire year. My team and I have to present the pitch deck for our product to the jury in a similar way how the startups pitch investors. We’ll get our grades and finish our Master of Science&nbsp;degree.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I’m 3/4 into the Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (<span class="caps">MSIE</span>) degree program at HEC Paris, and it is a time to write a reflection on my experience. I’ll think about whether it was worth the time and effort, and of course if I’m getting what I&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that a lot of universities and colleges moved to virtual classes. We, at <span class="caps">MSIE</span>, had a 100% virtual/online program from the beginning. Our cohort is number four which means HEC and Coursera figured out a lot of issues that they might have had before, like in any version 1.0 product. My cohort started in Jun 2019 so this post mark a year into the&nbsp;program.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Time flies. I’m already about two-thirds into the MSc Innovation and Entrepreneurship program at <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris. The previous post I wrote was <a href="http://azat.co/blog/hec-paris-4/">My <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris Journey, Part IV: Organize and Incentivize</a>. From the time I published it, I’ve taken these seven&nbsp;courses: </p>
<ol>
<li><em>Design Thinking</em>, </li>
<li><em>Social Entrepreneurship <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Changemaking</em>, </li>
<li><em>Scaling Up Operations</em>, </li>
<li><em>Marketing through Social Media</em>, </li>
<li><em>Team Working</em>, </li>
<li><em>How to Create a Business Plan</em>&nbsp;and</li>
<li><em>Fundamentals of Negotiation</em>. </li>
</ol>
<p>That’s a lot of courses in a span of several month. There were a lot of useful tidbits, insights and tips. Too many to write about right now. Ergo, I’ll talk in more details about the latest course which I finished today—<em>Fundamentals of Negotiation</em>.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>In English, to wish someone a nice and tasty meal is said with “enjoy your meal”. I never liked this phrase because it sounds like a command—enjoy! And if you don’t obey my command then there will be repercussions. Of course, it’s silly to think of this phrase this way but still the “enjoy your meal” phrase sounds too harsh and not elegant. Maybe people try to remind each other that they should enjoy their food instead of gulping fast food on the go or chowing down a salad while browsing Facebook and answering&nbsp;emails?</p>
