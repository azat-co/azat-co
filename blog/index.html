            <h2><a href="/blog/big-fish/">Big Fish in a Small Pound üêü</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It‚Äôs good to be a big fish in a small pond. It gives more visibility, uniqueness and influence that bring more opportunities. Also, it‚Äôs easier to migrate to a larger pond when you grow to a big fish in a small pond. So first, we all should focus on becoming a big fish in our current (probably small) pond. Stories of success of growing to a big fish in a large pond are mostly survivor bias type stories or overnight success stories that took 10 years in the making‚Ä¶ and a lot of jumps from small pond to bigger pond and then eventually to open&nbsp;ocean! </p>
<p>If the pond is too small, if you think that it‚Äôs not thrilling, motivating nor exciting to grow into a big fish there, then please take a second look. Probably, the pond is still big enough to be a stepping stone. A lot of startups try to launch straightway in the <span class="caps">US</span> or at least Europe while being from developing countries. That‚Äôs a big mistake because they are far from their customers and have all sorts of disadvantages of not playing on their&nbsp;home-field. </p>

          <section class="content"><p>This is the summary of my 2 years doing the master‚Äôs program. I received my paper diploma last week. I was awarded Master of Science with honors (only 10% of students get this high recognition). A few weeks ago, we had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_brulB6490">a virtual graduation ceremony</a>. I hope to visit the campus next year to reunite in person with my&nbsp;classmates. </p>
<p>While waiting for the diploma, I had a previlige to host a webinar with one of our professors, Prof. Etienne <span class="caps">KRIEGER</span> ‚Äî <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v1cEqGGXGI"><span class="caps">MSIE</span> Webinar : How to Overcome Conflicts Between Associates</a>.

<p>Anyone could have pitched their own idea to the whole cohort so that the most popular ideas attract teammates to collaborate. Some team had as many as six&nbsp;people! </p>

The course was on Venture Capital and Private Equity and it concludes the academic part of the masters program. I wrote academic because the courses weren‚Äôt just theoretical.

<p>Now, the only thing is left is to finish the team project that my team of three worked on for the pretty much the entire year. My team and I have to present the pitch deck for our product to the jury in a similar way how the startups pitch investors. We‚Äôll get our grades and finish our Master of Science&nbsp;degree.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>I‚Äôm 3/4 into the Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (<span class="caps">MSIE</span>) degree program at HEC Paris, and it is a time to write a reflection on my experience. I‚Äôll think about whether it was worth the time and effort, and of course if I‚Äôm getting what I&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth mentioning that a lot of universities and colleges moved to virtual classes. We, at <span class="caps">MSIE</span>, had a 100% virtual/online program from the beginning. Our cohort is number four which means HEC and Coursera figured out a lot of issues that they might have had before, like in any version 1.0 product. My cohort started in Jun 2019 so this post mark a year into the&nbsp;program.</p>

<li><em>Design Thinking</em>, </li>
<li><em>Social Entrepreneurship <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Changemaking</em>, </li>
<li><em>Scaling Up Operations</em>, </li>

<li><em>Team Working</em>, </li>
<li><em>How to Create a Business Plan</em>&nbsp;and</li>
<li><em>Fundamentals of Negotiation</em>. </li>
</ol>
<p>That‚Äôs a lot of courses in a span of several month. There were a lot of useful tidbits, insights and tips. Too many to write about right now. Ergo, I‚Äôll talk in more details about the latest course which I finished today‚Äî<em>Fundamentals of Negotiation</em>.</p>
