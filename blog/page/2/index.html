          <section class="content"><p>In English, to wish someone a nice and tasty meal is said with “enjoy your meal”. I never liked this phrase because it sounds like a command—enjoy! And if you don’t obey my command then there will be repercussions. Of course, it’s silly to think of this phrase this way but still the “enjoy your meal” phrase sounds too harsh and not elegant. Maybe people try to remind each other that they should enjoy their food instead of gulping fast food on the go or chowing down a salad while browsing Facebook and answering&nbsp;emails?</p>

This post will summarize two new courses that I’ve taken and passed: <em>New Product Development</em> and <em>Organizational Design and Management</em>. The common theme of these two courses is organizing teams and incentivizing them, hence the name of the&nbsp;post.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>It’s time to write a new blog post about my experience in the <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris Master of Science program. I’ve taken two new courses: Business strategy and Strategic Management of Innovation. They were somewhat related which was good for building a broad knowledge, because several concepts and topics were used and discussed from different angles in both courses. When I was a schoolboy, I liked strategy games like chess, Civilization and Command <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Conquer. I had to balance building roads and factories with investment in defense and military troops. As with these games, in business it’s all about the&nbsp;strategy. </p>
<p>Let me first tell me about the Business Strategy&nbsp;course.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/hec-paris/">Why I'm Getting a Second Master's Degree from HEC Paris</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/hec-paris/hec-paris.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Two months ago, I applied and was accepted to a master’s program at a prestigious business school (ranked #2), <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris. The degree is title <em>Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship</em> (<span class="caps">MSIE</span>). It has 10 normal courses, 10 practical project-based courses and one large team project. The master’s program lasts about one year and a half. Thus the program ends in 2020. However the graduation will be in 2021, because HEC has only one graduation ceremony which is held in its beautiful Paris&nbsp;campus.</p>
<p>I finished my first Master’s degree in 2007. It was Master of Science in Information Systems Technology from the University of Northern Virginia. I don’t like traditional universities and degrees. I’m a strong proponent of modern online education like Node University or Udacity. I taught at the Hack Reactor coding academy and I’m a huge fan of vocational schools that teach practical trades as oppose to abstract and theoretical knowledge unnecessary for the real-world jobs. Needless to say, that there are a lot of materials available online via YouTube and blogs. So it might come as a surprise that I’m getting a second masters degree. However, I decided to commit to getting a second Master of Science degree for the following&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation: When you pay 10s of thousands of dollars or euros you are more motivated to continue and finish the&nbsp;studies</li>
<li>Focus and pre-filter: Someone with a good reputation already did the selection for me. I avoid ads or possible distractions form web surfing when I’m on&nbsp;Coursera.</li>
<li>European perspective: Living in San Francisco and Silicon Valley area for the last seven years I understand that we live in a bubble here. <span class="caps">SF</span> is not the entire world which has other, bigger and more real, problems. It’s nice to hear and learn another perspective on business and&nbsp;innovation.</li>
<li>Content: Things change fast and after 12 years, it’ll be nice to become a student again and get a nice broad overview of current methods and techniques in entrepreneurship in a nice distraction-free format (reading blogs or watching YouTube is a&nbsp;pain!).</li>
<li>Experience: the <span class="caps">MSIE</span> program is mostly (50%+) project based which gives actual experience instead of just being abstract&nbsp;lectures.</li>
<li>Brand and Network: <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris is number 2 business school in Europe with a large and global presence, brand and alumni network. Brand is great because it attracts best student (for peer learning), best coaches (for projects) and best faculty (for&nbsp;lectures).</li>
<li>Convenience: The <span class="caps">MSIE</span> program is 100% online with weekly live calls, chat rooms, forums and online proctored exams. I don’t like the idea of being confined to one location and a set time for lectures for the next two years. With this format, I can travel often or even more to a new place all&nbsp;together.</li>
<li>Relatively cheap: The <span class="caps">MSIE</span>, HEC Paris program cost only 20,000 euros comparing to ~$30-40,000 USD for master’s from Harvard Extension or $150,000 USD for Wharton&nbsp;EMBA.</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked at other Master’s programs. In particular, I researched Wharton Executive <span class="caps">MBA</span> (WEMBA) in San Francisco. They fly all the faculty from Pennsylvania ever other week. I even took a few courses form the same program. The requirement of being tied and having to come to SF every other week for two years is too limiting for me. The price is very&nbsp;steel.</p>
<p>I looked at master degrees from Harvard Extension and even took a course from them. I didn’t like their approach. It’s too rigid with the focus on minute details, fact and rote memorization. The requirement for home assignment for some courses are too arcane (must be only in <span class="caps">MS</span> Word with certain font size and margins). The fact that they require students to come to every live webinar every week (missing even a single webinar is not allowed) is very depressing and limiting. The platform is clunky (can’t download videos for online&nbsp;viewing).</p>
<p>I like the <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris uses Coursera which is one of the best platforms for online courses. The MSIE content is relatively new and the approach is more practical. I’m in cohort 4 which means that it’s only fourth batch of students. If I’m not mistaken, cohorts 2 and 3 are still studying and haven’t graduated. Being in the 4<span class="ord">th</span> cohort means that university and Coursera ironed out all the kicks and perfected the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>The application process was lengthy but totally doable: few essays, video cover letter, bio, experience and two references (done by email). The Coursera and <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris staff are responsive and all the logistics ran smooth so far. The students have incredible backgrounds and I’m sure we’ll learn a great deal form each other in addition to the lectures and&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>I’ll try to keep writing about my journey through this innovative and practical Master of Science&nbsp;program.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I truly believe that human brains didn’t evolve to process complex data. Human conscious mind can only hold three, maybe five, seven max for some geniuses, items at a time. Because of that, I have a very optimistic belief when I’m faced with something complex and overwhelming: nothing complex is possible to build or comprehend. It’s optimistic because I know that everything can be broken down into small&nbsp;components.</p>
<p>For example, a large corporation or huge country are run by small hierarchical groups of three to seven people. Any large computer system can be broken down to modules, submodules and procedures inside of these submodules. When faced with a new undertaking, a study or a seemingly complex system, I remind myself to keep things simple stupid, or to keep them simple,&nbsp;stupid.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/work-rest/">Work and Rest</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Working is important. It not only provides material means, social status and pride in a well work done, but also meaning and motivation which in tern extend a person’s life. According to <a href="http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2016/03/21/jech-2015-207097.short">some studies</a>, people who retire and don’t find another activity, die fast. Or that tech millionaires are unhappy once they are let go or fire, or that lottery winners are miss the&nbsp;working. </p>
<p>However, resting is important too and helps to avoid burn-out and all kids of nasty nervous diseases which tend to decrease one’s life. Working productively while having rest once in a while is the best approach. 👨‍💻🔄🛌  <strong>What’s crazy is that many people do things which they think is resting but in fact they are draining their energy even more.</strong> Here are some of these things. Some of them might shock&nbsp;you!</p>
<ul>
<li>Going out on the weekend: Breaking your sleep cycle with loud noise, excessive drinking or eating - not&nbsp;good.</li>
<li>Traveling, especially stressful traveling: Being in a nice place taken care of by the hotel staff and restaurants is nice but the traveling itself is almost always a stress (airport, planes, traffic). Trying new food and changing time zones are bad stressors&nbsp;to. </li>
<li>Watching sports, <span class="caps">TV</span> shows or news: they all drain your energy because your body is passive yet emotions and adrenaline glands are&nbsp;not.</li>
<li>Being on social media: More people feel depressed after using social media due to “success theatre” and the addiction mechanism of&nbsp;novelty.</li>
<li>Multitasking: Not being in the present and flow state, e.g., when you at your kids soccer game, don’t text with work. That’s a disservice to you, work and your family. Be present whatever you do. Put your phone on an airplane mode. Most likely you are not a firefighter or a brain surgeon. You work can wait until the weekend is&nbsp;over.</li>
<li>Not sleeping enough or waking up on the weekend at different&nbsp;hours.</li>
<li>Eating refined carbs (pizza, pasta, juices, smoothies): Sugar is easily digestible form spike insulin and very toxic for your&nbsp;body.</li>
<li>Not getting resistance training and doing too much chronic cardio: Chronic cardio is a huge stressor, tough on joints and ages people&nbsp;fast.</li>
<li>Smoking weed: If smoking tobacco causes cancer due to the burned stuff that people inhale, then why burning weed and smoking it <em>wouldn’t</em> cause cancer&nbsp;too?</li>
<li>Hanging out with “friends”: Wrong type of friends can bring drama and having too much drama in your life is not good for mental&nbsp;health.</li>
<li>Postponing important things, i.e., procrastination: It might feel good short-term to postpone an important project or a decision but it’ll snowball stress in the&nbsp;long-term.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably more things which are misleading to people. They mask as rest but actually suck up your energy. I would say not watching news or <span class="caps">TV</span> shows and having enough sleep are two most important which will give the majority the most bang for their buck. Focus on that if you feel&nbsp;tired!</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This year I had a lot of changes. And I’ll have more until the end of year! It started with a small one. I upgraded my laptop. The tool which I use 8-10 hours everyday. Then I changed the place of living… and did other <em>really</em> big life changes. Small things lead to big changes. It’s a snowball. I remember something about cognitive dissonance. Probably that’s it. If you are decisive and not afraid of changes for good, then it translates to other areas of life and&nbsp;work… </p>
<p>What’s funny is that every big change which I did was perceived as bigger before but in fact was 10x easier. The lesson: <strong>don’t think changing is hard</strong>. Stop your mind when it starts to envision any problems or hurdles  which might not even materialize. Of course, account for the worse scenario but don’t paralyze yourself with excessive analysis. <em>Avoid analysis paralysis by taking action even if it’s a small action at&nbsp;first.</em></p>

          <section class="content"><p>A lot of people think they lack motivation. They feel lazy. They listen to Gary Vaynerchuk or Tony Robinns. It might help for a while but why not solve the problem at the root cause? What these people really lack is a big enough “why”. They become complacent because most of their needs are met. Simply take on more and larger responsibilities and you’ll be motivated. Get new bigger problems to solve. Find a new job, get married, start a family, have kids, sign a book contract, start or buy a business. You’ll see your motivation will skyrocket, and the complacency will&nbsp;decrease!</p>
