            <h2><a href="/blog/digital-life/">About Efficiency, Digital and Remote Work</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Needless to say that cafes, <a href="http://azat.co/blog/open-offices">open offices</a>, commute and slow internet all impede productivity. To increase efficiency, distraction-free <a href="http://azat.co/blog/flow">flow</a> and productivity, I stayed home for a few days over the weekend to work on a&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>I finished the project and made some money all digitally and remotely via the Internet and phone. I ordered food (groceries) using food delivery services. I worked out in a gym in my building and got fresh air on my&nbsp;patio.</p>
<p>The result was an weird feeling that I don’t need to leave my home at all. It’s almost magical to realize the digital inflow of money (salary and book royalties) and digital outflow (to pay for food). Also, I was healthier because I cooked at home instead of eating out, and I didn’t listen to gossips or read/watch news even in passing on a gym’s <span class="caps">TV</span> or in&nbsp;metro.</p>
<p>It’s fascinating that all can be done digitally witout leaving one’s home and it’s peculiar how little humans needs sometimes for productive, satisfactory and healthy&nbsp;live.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/delegation/">The Right and Wrong Ways to Delegate</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>My main jobs are software engineering and writing. They are crafts and as with many crafts they are harder to delegate. Think mass produced car vs. designing a car and the factory to mass produce it. Software and books are scalable because they can be replicated infinitely without any loss, but the actual act of writing them is a creative hard-to-scale&nbsp;process. </p>
<p>Over the years of writing software and books, I’ve been learning to identify and delegate some repeatable tasks. I learned that the right way to delegate is to find a repeatable task which you know a) cannot be easily automated b) needs to be performed 100+ times or 2+ hours, and c) straightforward to document and&nbsp;explain. </p>
<p>There’s a cost of review. Do not skip reviewing the end work and either fixing mistakes yourself or sending it back for a re-work (in this case always review again). Reviewing helps not only to make a better product but it’ll give you the confidence in your product and your team (or not but then you at least know and can fix issue&nbsp;later).</p>
<p>Some leader say, never delegate things you are not willing to do yourself. It’s <span class="caps">B.S.</span> Everything is situational. I delegated things I dreaded doing and they got done. If I didn’t delegate them, they could have taken longer (procrastination) or would have never materialized at all. Done is better than perfect in this case. However, running at least the first 3-4 times through the routine will help you greatly in writing instructions and standard operation procedures&nbsp;(SOPs). </p>
<p>Do not delegate to perform things which do not make sense financially and don’t be cheap on things which will generate&nbsp;revenue. </p>
<p>Delegate at things you think you are okay or good (even worse), but in reality you suck at. For example, a lot of programmers think they are good at design and their confidence leads to terrible websites, book covers and software which prevents them from making more&nbsp;sales. </p>
<p>To summarize this post,&nbsp;do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delegate to get better supplemental skill to your own and don’t be cheap,&nbsp;e.g.,design</li>
<li>Change process to eliminate or automate, e.g., create a self-service instead of customer support or use <span class="caps">AWS</span> RDS instead of maintaining a&nbsp;database</li>
<li>Delegate repeatable tasks by having detailed easy to follow&nbsp;instructions</li>
<li>Always review before the final&nbsp;step</li>
<li>Delegate scary for you tasks but only after you’ve done them a few times and they’ve stopped being&nbsp;scary</li>
<li>Constantly re-evaluate, i.e., look for opportunities to change to a cheaper provider or simplify the&nbsp;process</li>
<li>Delegate to get a second opinion, e.g., tech review, copy&nbsp;editing</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of things you <em>probably</em> shouldn’t be doing&nbsp;yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design (for programmers or&nbsp;writers)</li>
<li>Scheduling appointments by&nbsp;phone</li>
<li>Fixing formatting, links, code, fonts, etc. in <span class="caps">MS</span> Word, Markdown, and other&nbsp;formats</li>
<li>First pass at creating captions and&nbsp;transcriptons</li>
<li>First pass at video&nbsp;editing</li>
<li>Spinning up and maintaining your own database instead of using&nbsp;BaaS</li>
<li>Spinning up and maintaining your own servers (virtual machines) instead of using&nbsp;PaaS</li>
<li>Importing, exporting, enrolling instead of&nbsp;automating</li>
<li>Submitting to any forms: job boards, conferences (request for proposals), clients,&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li>Posting to social&nbsp;media</li>
<li>Deploying code instead of having&nbsp;<span class="caps">CD</span></li>
<li>Testing code instead of having&nbsp;<span class="caps">CI</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Do not delegate (or automate) things when one or more&nbsp;applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will  faster for you to do it and it’s not a repeatable task then to train and review (review can take a long&nbsp;time)</li>
<li>It’s a last step&nbsp;review</li>
<li>It’s hard to describe (means&nbsp;creative) </li>
<li>It’s a core function for&nbsp;you </li>
<li>It requires extremely high standards which will cost you too much or hard to find people to&nbsp;do</li>
<li>It’s&nbsp;marketing/sales</li>
</ul>

            <h2><a href="/blog/changing-unconscious/">Changing Unconscious</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>As I was reviewing transcripts for one of my Node University courses, I was surprised to see so many “so”, “um”, and “ah” filler words. It was a very painful experience to realize that your speech is far from perfect. Of course, with training most people can improve their speech: avoid filler words, accents and improve intonation. This is what professional voice actors, news anchors and movie stars did. And they are in high demand and&nbsp;popular! </p>
<p>Think of it, a lot of improvements to the unconscious actions such as speech, language, writing, personal finance (it’s defined by habits not logic), eating and fitness are the <strong>hardest</strong>, but they bring the most rewards once you make the changes. Unconscious changes are the hardest, but at the same time they are the <em>easiest</em> to maintain once acquired. The reason is that there’s an autopilot effect. The reward part comes from the fact that there are fewer people who can change those unconscious things in or around&nbsp;them. </p>
<p>For example, if you train yourself to speak well, you can become a Pluralsight course author or a paid public speaker. If you invest time and effort in Spanish, you can speak it without translating from English to Spanish. Not many people can do either of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Unconscious autopilots are great, but tweaking them takes time and efforts. Ego is crushed which makes for less competition. <em>There are no traffic jams on the extra mile</em>. The good thing is that once you applied the change, everything can go back to the autopilot: now you <a href="http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers">eat healthy</a> without thinking about it, <a href="http://azat.co/blog/flow">focus quicker</a> and read more of good <a href="http://azat.co/blog/200-books">books</a>. </p>
<p>It’s funny how things work but knowing that there’s a big reward ahead if you can tweak a bad unconscious habit into a good one creates a good&nbsp;motivation.</p>

First, the parallels between risk, casino, gambling and the stock market. Second, the fact that the author was innovating and constantly moving forward into areas which are still not saturated and still unproved away from techniques and areas which became more competitive and mainstream. Natural curiosity and data-driven non-emotional approach helped the author a lot! These are my notes about the book which I highly recommend reading, so if next time someone tells you that the casino always wins, your can refer them to this book which proved&nbsp;otherwise.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/time-tips/">10 Easy Tips to Create More Time in Your Life</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Being busy has became a badge of honor. For me, it’s just plain stupid. I do a lot of things but I’m not busy. In fact, one of the questions people ask me a lot is “How do you find&nbsp;time?”</p>
<p>First of all, you cannot find it. It’s not a pair of sun glasses which you left at a beach. You can’t find time or lose it… but you can spend it on stupid things or lasting valuable good&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>Let me give some examples of stupid thing that I <em>generally</em> avoid doing and some time&nbsp;tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid texting with friends - just freaking call or talk in person when you want talk, and use text is only for scheduling&nbsp;hangouts</li>
<li>Use activities which do not require focus like folding laundry, washing dishes or writing <span class="caps">HTML</span> to listen to audio books and good podcasts. That’s how I was able to <a href="http://azat.co/blog/200-books">consume over 200 books in the last three years</a>.</li>
<li>Avoid reading Facebook timeline or looking at Instagram news feed. Only post, don’t&nbsp;consume.</li>
<li>Avoid checking Twitter feed and when you do only subscribe to a handful of people, no more than 200 people and look into “In case you missed&nbsp;it”</li>
<li>Watch movie traiglers instead of full movies. I only watch movies trailers in planes that’s enough to see all the good scenes and in 80% of the cases understand the plot… but even that makes me want to puke either because modern movies are so brain-dead or full of loser-oriented propaganda (e.g.,&nbsp;Hangover)</li>
<li>Pretend <span class="caps">TV</span> and cable do not exist and skip commercials by getting Netflix or Amazon Prime if you want some dumb&nbsp;entertainment</li>
<li>Ignore surveys or providing feedback beyond stars or thumbs on hotels, flights, books, apps,&nbsp;services</li>
<li>Avoid writing reviews unless I really want for my own notes/thinking as I did with <a href="https://webapplog.com/managing-humans-summary/">Managing Humans</a> or <a href="http://azat.co/blog/barbell">Antifragile</a></li>
<li>Avoid being tired because when you are tired you want to take a break, a long weekend or a vacation. Don’t get tired in the first place! To do so, <a href="http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers">eat property</a>, exercise and have a good sleep <em>every night</em>.</li>
<li>Avoid reading popular magazines, Medium, blog posts, news—<a href="http://azat.co/blog/ignorance">ignorance is a bliss</a> in these&nbsp;cases</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t confuse activity with results. Being busy is not equates with achieving a lot. Observe what things are wasteful and not productive. Just the act of observing will help you to gain more time to be more productive while spending less time and being less busy and&nbsp;tired!</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/success-formula/">Success Formula</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Before I wrote that <a href="http://azat.co/blog/success-is-boring">success is boring</a>. It still sounds true to me now, but I noticed a simple yet powerful formula for success. It works in almost all cases as far as I know based on dozens of biographies and autobiographies I’ve read and&nbsp;heard.</p>
<p><strong>Success is talent plus hard work plus&nbsp;luck.</strong></p>
<p>Talent is about up-brining and genes. It’s related to luck but the luck formula component itself is more about present and future than predetermined past of early childhood, country of origin, language or&nbsp;culture.</p>
<p>The luck in the formula could be generated by more hard work (more activity leads to more opportunity), but it’s not a guaranteed linear relationship because statistically numbers could be low for the cause and effect to play&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>Hard work is self explanatory. More talent can require less hard work and vice versa if you are less talented you could compensate to a certain degree with hard&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>So three components are related and might affect one another but as a general direction this formula clear and universal. It makes going for success in any area&nbsp;straightforward.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/social-media/">How to Use Social Media Right for Much Benefit and to Stay Sane and Productive</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/social-media/jordan-whitfield-97337.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Most people use social media wrong. They scroll through what seems to be a never ending timeline…down, down, down. They come back in half an hour and scroll again to see something new. Down, down, down… and when they see the posts they’ve already seen earlier in the day, they switch to another app: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google +, Vine, Snapchat, WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or Skype. When they’ve checked everything they have installed and signed up for… it’s time to repeat the&nbsp;cycle.</p>
<p>People check social media on their phone, but then they are on their laptops or desktop computers. It’s time to check everything <strong>again</strong> because, you know, something new might have happened or after all, Facebook website and Facebook mobile app are so different from each other!&nbsp;😏 </p>
<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong. You are just consuming low quality content for a thrill of dopamine released by your novelty seeking lizard brain (<a href="https://vimeo.com/5895898">Amygdala</a>) 🐲. You are a gambling addict, a slot machine junking pulling the lever down, down, down. You are wasting time, getting full of ads, and losing your brain cycles (where the focus goes energy&nbsp;flows).</p>
<p>The right usage of media about harnessing the power of social media to your benefit, here are some of the&nbsp;examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Message, video, chat with friends and organize in-person meetings. Connecting has never been so cheap and&nbsp;easy.</li>
<li>It’s not what you know, it’s whom you know so keep your contacts saved for future interactions (your rolodex), both business (Twitter, LinkedIn) and personal (Facebook,&nbsp;WhatsApp)</li>
<li>Post valuable, useful and interesting updates. Sorry but what you ate for breakfast or what is the view form of your window does <span class="caps">NOT</span> count unless you are a celebrity (they are&nbsp;forgiven).</li>
</ul>
<p>I check my social media accounts just once a week. I almost never look at the timeline and never for a long period of time. I <em>proactively</em> reach out to people, search topics and hashtags, and then message and comment. I check my notifications and reply to the ones that need replies. I deleted all the social media apps from my phone and don’t miss them. It helps me to focus on important matters and act instead of reacting.&nbsp;😇</p>
<p>Use social media to your advantage and don’t let social media consume&nbsp;you!</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/create-course/">How to Create an Online Course in Five Simple Steps</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/create-course/DeathtoStock_ModernWorkshop-04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Create an online course to learn something yourself, to promote one of your other products, to help others and to make <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3047592/this-online-school-for-developers-pays-teachers-millions-of-dollars">millions</a>. Here are the five simple&nbsp;steps.</p>
<p>First, <strong>pick a topic</strong>. To create an online course, you are <span class="caps">NOT</span> required to have expertise in a topic. Although having it will speed up the process from a few weeks, or even months, to a few day, or even hours. Seriously. It took me 0 time to create my first online course on Node. I just invited a friend to record my workshop. I already knew the material. The course has close to 20,000 students&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Then, <strong>create an outline</strong>. Give it to someone who is not your lover or close friend because they are <strong><span class="caps">NOT</span></strong> likely to give you an honest feedback. Even better, ask someone to pay you for the course based on the outline. It’s called <span class="caps">MVP</span> and pre-sales. It’s the best way to test an&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>create slides</strong>. I use Deckset but you can use Powerpoint or Keynotes. Whatever you already know or the fastest to learn. Google presentation is the best choice after&nbsp;Markdown.</p>
<p>Fourth, find a quiet place, and then <strong>record voice overs</strong>. If you’re on macOS, then you can just use QuickTime. I use Screenflow which is just $100. You might need to re-record a few times before you get it right. It’s normal. No pressure. No one will see your&nbsp;failures.</p>
<p>Fifth, <strong>upload videos</strong> somewhere. You can use simplistic YouTube or Vimeo, or more advanced Teachable or Thinkific. It doesn’t matter at this point too much, so don’t spend hour upon hours on research. The goal is to find at least 10 customers for your course and get their feedback. After that you can always update slides, re-record videos or change&nbsp;platforms.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;summarize,</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a&nbsp;topic</li>
<li>Create an&nbsp;outline</li>
<li>Create&nbsp;slides</li>
<li>Record voice over videos (slides +&nbsp;audio)</li>
<li>Upload&nbsp;videos</li>
</ol>
<p>What are you waiting for? Your students <em>need</em> you. Go and create a&nbsp;course!</p>
<p><span class="caps">PS</span>: If you are interested in hearing my full story on how I transitioned from writing coding books to being an online course creator, then I wrote a book about it. Check it out. It’s called <a href="http://amzn.to/1IjQazP">ProgWriter 2</a>.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/open-offices/">Idiocy of Open Offices</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/open-offices/office.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve been doing software engineering for over 15 years now, and I always had to sit in an open office space. Sometimes like at <span class="caps">FDIC</span> or NIH, I had a short wall to form a noise barrier- sort of a cubicle. The walls are only shoulder length so they are still a galaxy away from being sound proof. Especially when the desk is in the hallway like how mine was at FDIC, or near a chatty NIH colleague who spends hours everyday talking with someone on the phone in loud Cantonese. Argh. Human voice is very distracting even when you don’t understand&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>However, that set up is luxury compared to the idiocy of open offices practiced by startup and large corporations on the West Coast. There are rows upon rows of narrow tables with 50 or 100+ people in giant rooms. Tables to tables. Rows and rows. This is a 21<span class="ord">st</span> analog of an industrial age&nbsp;factory.</p>
<p>But in this information age, the metrics are not tangible goods. They are harder to measure, and this is what fools senior leadership, office designers, founders and CEOs/COOs. <em>Activity is not “result”.</em> Do they put everyone in the open to reduce slacking because they can’t effectively measure results? (Slack and <span class="caps">IM</span> are constant distractions too but that’s a different <a href="http://azat.co/blog/flow">story</a>. At least you can turn them&nbsp;off!)</p>
<p>In fancy San Francisco unicorn “startups” or giant Silicon Valley corporations, you can be next to a ping pong, foosball or a product manager. With <strong>all this noise</strong> and distractions, people can’t work. They tire quickly because they go to chat with co-workers, laugh, and play another stupid game which should be banned from any office, which only adds to the noise even more. Catch&nbsp;22.</p>
<p>Since there’s little work that can be done between 9-5pm, people come early or stay late… or work from home to get at least something done. When they are in the office from 9 to 5, only shallow work gets done. Deep work is almost impossible in an open office. That, and distractions in the form of useless meetings, social media, email arguments, long lunch breaks sprinkled with lots of coffee breaks and gossiping- just anything to kill the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>And no, noise cancelling headphones are not a solution because the music is a distraction itself and none of it will help from a nerf dart being shot at you (as often happened at DocuSign and was source of constant(something is missing&nbsp;here)).</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line is that open office employees become dumber</strong> because all they can do is shallow work. Also some of them will&nbsp;become:</p>
<ul>
<li>More negative: Social media, procrastination and late night works at home to catch&nbsp;up</li>
<li>Dissatisfied: Deep work is very&nbsp;rewarding</li>
<li>Fatter: All the stress, and the extra snack (typically free), and coffee breaks will increase your chances of survival if you ever will be marooned on a deserted&nbsp;island</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies waste money because they are paying for unproductive time. Yes. Companies save on real estate, but if there are more remote workers there would be virtually zero demand for office space for&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed, most of my best work happens in early mornings or late evenings when I’m at alone at the office or at home and the neighbors’ twin toddlers are not crying. I hate open offices. They are just a bit better than working from a cafe or an airplane. At least in a cafe you are surrounded by strangers and not obligated to talk to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>People are in the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap">open office trap</a>. Some escaped it by <a href="https://shift.newco.co/why-i-only-work-remotely-2e5eb07ae28f#.lly2vlxxo">working only remotely</a>. Good for them, but for the rest of us it’s a vicious circle of frustration, stress, dissatisfaction and becoming dumber due to inability to perform at peak level and do deep&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Let’s come up with a solution. How about having <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/restoring-sanity-to-the-office-d9d35dd8689e#.fme2rq3i4">library rule</a> in an office like what BaseCamp has? No games, no nerf guns, no talking on the freaking phone (even if you’re a product manager). And the community areas and kitchens can have all the collaboration, chat and noise they want.&nbsp;:)</p>
<p><span class="caps">PS</span>: Michael Lopp in his top-seller book <a href="http://amzn.to/2kEFQ0z">Managing Humans</a>, which I highly recommend reading, refers to collaboration as “a word used to convince you to work with people you’d rather&nbsp;avoid.”</p>

Scott is the creator of the <a href="http://dilbert.com">Dilbert</a> cartoon series. He is also a hypnotist and a master of the mindset. I highly recommend his book. Here are the three&nbsp;nuggets:</p>
<p><strong>Goals are for losers.</strong> Use routines instead. Routines will make you have progress without constantly focusing on how far your goal is. So keep your goals but don’t obsess over them being too far. Instead build routines and system to make progress towards your goals daily or at least&nbsp;weekly.</p>
<p><strong>Luck can be generated.</strong> It’s a product of your skills. The more relevant skills you have, the better. Learning skills like public speaking, hypnosis, writing, programming, or second language (or third like I am doing right now) - all will increase your chances and&nbsp;luck.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion could be given for being unqualified</strong>. This is how Scott was promoted in not one but two big companies. His job wasn’t what he was supposed to do but finding and interviewing for the next job. Think about it. Interviewing and day job are often two very separate things and skill sets. This is very true in tech and <span class="caps">IT</span> field! My own experience of frustration over tech interviewing is described in <a href="https://webapplog.com/i-will-puke-if-i-hear-array-search-interview-question-again">I will puke if I hear array search interview question again</a>.</p>
<p>Scott has many other gems in his book. He is also funny, but not <em>too</em> funny since the book is actually on a serious topic of success, career and the proper mindset. Get your own <a href="http://amzn.to/2mpZLlh">copy</a> and read&nbsp;it!</p>
