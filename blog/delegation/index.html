          <section class="content"><p>My main jobs are software engineering and writing. They are crafts and as with many crafts they are harder to delegate. Think mass produced car vs. designing a car and the factory to mass produce it. Software and books are scalable because they can be replicated infinitely without any loss, but the actual act of writing them is a creative hard-to-scale&nbsp;process. </p>
<p>Over the years of writing software and books, Iâ€™ve been learning to identify and delegate some repeatable tasks. I learned that the right way to delegate is to find a repeatable task which you know a) cannot be easily automated b) needs to be performed 100+ times or 2+ hours, and c) straightforward to document and&nbsp;explain. </p>
<p>Thereâ€™s a cost of review. Do not skip reviewing the end work and either fixing mistakes yourself or sending it back for a re-work (in this case always review again). Reviewing helps not only to make a better product but itâ€™ll give you the confidence in your product and your team (or not but then you at least know and can fix issue&nbsp;later).</p>
<p>Some leader say, never delegate things you are not willing to do yourself. Itâ€™s <span class="caps">B.S.</span> Everything is situational. I delegated things I dreaded doing and they got done. If I didnâ€™t delegate them, they could have taken longer (procrastination) or would have never materialized at all. Done is better than perfect in this case. However, running at least the first 3-4 times through the routine will help you greatly in writing instructions and standard operation procedures&nbsp;(SOPs). </p>
<p>Do not delegate to perform things which do not make sense financially and donâ€™t be cheap on things which will generate&nbsp;revenue. </p>
<p>Delegate at things you think you are okay or good (even worse), but in reality you suck at. For example, a lot of programmers think they are good at design and their confidence leads to terrible websites, book covers and software which prevents them from making more&nbsp;sales. </p>
<p>To summarize this post,&nbsp;do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delegate to get better supplemental skill to your own and donâ€™t be cheap,&nbsp;e.g.,design</li>
<li>Change process to eliminate or automate, e.g., create a self-service instead of customer support or use <span class="caps">AWS</span> RDS instead of maintaining a&nbsp;database</li>
<li>Delegate repeatable tasks by having detailed easy to follow&nbsp;instructions</li>
<li>Always review before the final&nbsp;step</li>
<li>Delegate scary for you tasks but only after youâ€™ve done them a few times and theyâ€™ve stopped being&nbsp;scary</li>
<li>Constantly re-evaluate, i.e., look for opportunities to change to a cheaper provider or simplify the&nbsp;process</li>
<li>Delegate to get a second opinion, e.g., tech review, copy&nbsp;editing</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of things you <em>probably</em> shouldnâ€™t be doing&nbsp;yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design (for programmers or&nbsp;writers)</li>
<li>Scheduling appointments by&nbsp;phone</li>
<li>Fixing formatting, links, code, fonts, etc. in <span class="caps">MS</span> Word, Markdown, and other&nbsp;formats</li>
<li>First pass at creating captions and&nbsp;transcriptons</li>
<li>First pass at video&nbsp;editing</li>
<li>Spinning up and maintaining your own database instead of using&nbsp;BaaS</li>
<li>Spinning up and maintaining your own servers (virtual machines) instead of using&nbsp;PaaS</li>
<li>Importing, exporting, enrolling instead of&nbsp;automating</li>
<li>Submitting to any forms: job boards, conferences (request for proposals), clients,&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li>Posting to social&nbsp;media</li>
<li>Deploying code instead of having&nbsp;<span class="caps">CD</span></li>
<li>Testing code instead of having&nbsp;<span class="caps">CI</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Do not delegate (or automate) things when one or more&nbsp;applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will  faster for you to do it and itâ€™s not a repeatable task then to train and review (review can take a long&nbsp;time)</li>
<li>Itâ€™s a last step&nbsp;review</li>
<li>Itâ€™s hard to describe (means&nbsp;creative) </li>
<li>Itâ€™s a core function for&nbsp;you </li>
<li>It requires extremely high standards which will cost you too much or hard to find people to&nbsp;do</li>
<li>Itâ€™s&nbsp;marketing/sales</li>
</ul>
